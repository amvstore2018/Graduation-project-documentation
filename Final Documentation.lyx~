Using drones in Percision Agriculture

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agricultural drones have been changing the face of farming and cultivation
 heavily the past 3-5 years, and completely changing the way that many farmers
 and other entities go about their business.
 This drones have the ability to check storm damage, monitor crop progress,
 and make sure that both crops and herds are healthy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Precision agriculture is a farming management concept that uses drones for
 agriculture to measure, observe, and respond to variability found in crops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you implement all of the new technology that is available out there
 including drones in agriculture, you can apply resources (even if limited),
 to make sure that the farm has a very maximum yield.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Crop Health
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is no secret that there is a strong need for increased agricultural productio
n given the increase expected in population around the globe.
 There are finite agriculture resources and growers are expected to produce
 more with less.
 The need for improved management practices is acute.
 In order to implement improved practices reliable, timely, and actionable
 data is required.
 Enter in-season on-demand aerial imagery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aerial imagery is used by consultants (CCAs, scouts, agronomists), cooperatives,
 and agriculture service providers to assist in calculating the economic
 differences between the “good” and “bad” crop condition zones enabling
 improved management decisions.
 Often times, determining crop health without the “bird’s eye view” from
 aerial imagery is difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the main image types to determine crop health is the Near Infrared
 (NIR) image.
 The NIR is most effective to determine the vegetative health of the crop
 as the other imagery bands (Red, Blue, Green) are “absorbed” by the plant
 to create food.

\begin_layout Standard
The NIR band used in conjunction with the red band is utilized to create
 a vegetation index commonly called a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
 (NDVI).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NDVI provides quantitative information on the health of the crop in
 the field.
 The green colored zones have the most robust and volume of vegetation while
 the yellow and red zones represent less vegetation.
 This information can be used to make management decisions on the application
 of inputs like fertilizer and fungicide.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Compaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The term “soil compaction” refers to a change in state of the soil that
 increases its bulk density.
 Soil compaction is becoming more and more important due to the fact that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Equipment is larger 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Uncontrolled traffic 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Operating on wet soils
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identifying compacted areas within a field with the naked eye is difficult
 and compaction is a difficult variable to measure from the ground without
 equipment (eg soil penetrometer) and high labor costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a soil is over-compacted there is significant risk of yield reductions
 as compacted soils affect both soil and plant growth alike:

Aerial imagery shows subtle patterns of soil compaction that are almost
 impossible to see from the ground.
 By comparing patterns of traffic and irregular crop growth, problem areas
 due to compaction are easily identifiable.
 In Figure 1 above, the red areas on the north side of the field showed
 yield losses of 45-65 bushels per acre while the red strip on the east
 side showed yield losses of 20-30 bushels per acre

\begin_layout Paragraph
Variable rate application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Variable rate application (VRA) is the method of applying varying rates
 of inputs in the appropriate zones within an individual field.
 The ultimate goals of VRA are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Maximize farm profitability 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Increase efficiencies in the application of crop inputs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ensure environmental safety and sustainability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The management of in-season nitrogen application(s) is a critical component
 to land management.
 Mismanagement can result in yield loss and negative impacts to the environment.
 Given this importance, companies and individuals alike are turning toward
 aerial imagery as a means to develop nitrogen management zones and the
 corresponding VRA.
 The economical nitrogen rate can vary substantially within individual fields.
 It is difficult to assess these differences in a timely manner without
 the use of remote sensing.
 An aerial image, when analyzed appropriately, can provide the agronomist
 with key insights on the crop.
 For example, the near-infrared (NIR) light reflecting off a nitrogen stressed
 corn crop is quite less than a non-nitrogen stressed crop.

\begin_layout Standard
Once aerial images have been utilized to target scouting efforts, a VRA
 fertilization file can be created using precision agriculture software
 (ie Mapshots, SST, AgFleet, etc…) Another application of aerial imagery
 for VRA is using the bare soil image to create zones to apply soil nutrients
 and/or amendments.
 Whether you are looking at VR seeding, VRA for fertilization, or VRA for
 herbicide/fungicide and aerial image is the data layer to use to enable
 better management decisions and increase profitability.

Drones aren't always mentioned in the same breath as saving lives, but a

\begin_layout Standard
Civilian drones have been used to save at least 59 people in 18 different
 incidents around the world since 2013, DJI, a China-based company that
 manufacturers popular civilian drones, said in a statement on Tuesday.
 The company added that 38 of those individuals were saved within in the
 last 10 months thanks to rescue teams and civilians employing their unmanned
 aerial vehicles (UAV) to aid people facing life-threatening emergencies.

 So they get smooth and jerk-free panoramic viewing when they need it and
 can respond quickly to events.
 The camera can be column-mounted, on poles or walls for a 360° panoramic
 view and a ground-to-sky view from -90° to +45°.
 It can withstand high winds when it’s in motion of up to 47-meter per second

Firefighting Drones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In search and rescue operations, drones allow greater coverage of a search
 area – and thermography allows rescue teams to work through the night,
 significantly increasing the potential for success.
 Thermal imaging cameras give teams the power to “see in total darkness,”
 says FLIR, the global leader in thermo-graphic imaging sensors.
 Added to that is the ability to discern figures difficult to find with
 traditional cameras even in daylight- like one stranded hiker lost against
 the backdrop of a snowy field.
 This capacity is one of several reasons that law enforcement organizations
 around the world are using drones.
 Firefighting may provide one of the most compelling applications for drones
 equipped with thermal imaging equipment.
 From New York City’s famous FDNY to volunteer departments in small towns
 around the country, fire departments are utilizing drone technology to
 save structures and victims, and minimize risk to firefighters.
 The aerial perspective through a thermal imaging camera allows teams to
 pinpoint hotspots, identify victims on the scene, and quickly establish
 a plan of attack.
 It provides a level of visibility in the midst of a fire that is impossible
 with the naked eye or traditional cameras.
 (You can see how a fire looks through the lens of one of these thermo-graphic
 tools here – experiencing a firefighters view through dark and smoke.) Drones
 not only make firefighters more effective – they keep them safe.

Using drones in Disaster Relief and Emergency Response
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aerial drones are one of the most promising and powerful new technologies
 to improve disaster response and relief operations.
 Drones naturally complement traditional manned relief operations by helping
 to ensure that operations can be conducted safer, faster, and more efficiently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a disaster occurs, drones may be used to provide relief workers with
 better situational awareness, locate survivors amidst the rubble, perform
 structural analysis of damaged infrastructure, deliver needed supplies
 and equipment, evacuate casualties, and help extinguish fires among many
 other potential applications.

 When individuals, businesses, and communities are able to understand and
 manage risks and plan effectively, they reduce overall damage and losses.
 Rebuilding and recovery are then able to begin more quickly and ultimately

\begin_layout Standard
Drones have long been described as optimally suited to perform the “3-D”
 missions, often described as dirty, dull, and dangerous.
 They can provide needed aerial data in areas considered too hazardous for
 people on the ground or for manned aircraft operation, such as sites with
 nuclear radiation contamination or in close proximity to wildfires.
 Drones can also deliver needed supplies and relay Wi-Fi and cellular phone
 service when communications are needed the most.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Disaster relief and emergency response (DRER) efforts are inclusive of all
 actions by first responders and subsequent aid efforts during and immediately
 following a catastrophic event which threatens human life.The primary purpose
 of DRER efforts is to save human lives.
 Secondary purposes of DRER efforts are to preserve and maintain the environment
, protect property, keep the peace, and uphold governmental authority.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
UAV systems have the potential to improve the effectiveness of DRER efforts
 by enhancing first responder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Modern manned DRER systems include ground vehicles, conventional aircraft,
 and rotorcraft capabilities and providing advanced predictive capabilities
 and early warning.
 A wide variety of system types of all sizes with varying capabilities already
 exist with even more under development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Disasters or emergencies for which DRER UAV systems could be implemented
 include: severe storms, tornados, hurricanes, wild fires, tsunamis, floods,
 earthquakes, avalanches, civil disturbances, oil or chemical spills, and
 urban disasters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Civil unmanned aerial vehicle systems have potential to augment disaster
 relief and emergency response efforts.
 Optimal design of aerial systems for such applications will lead to unmanned
 vehicles which provide maximum potentiality for relief and emergency response
 while accounting for public safety concerns and regulatory requirements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Major Usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Reconnaissance and Mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The need for regular mapping of disaster-prone areas cannot be overstated.
 Flood maps help coordinate disaster response eff orts after events like
 the Superstorm Sandy storm surge; 3D topographical mapping can help identify
 areas prone to mudslide; high-resolution visual imaging can help first
 responders flag critical infrastructure that needs to be secured immediately
 after a disaster; and advances in remote sensing technology have opened
 new possibilities in developing early warning signs for potential disasters.
 For example, British researchers operating in Malaysia have used drones
 to map patterns of deforestation that have been correlated with increased
 incidences of malaria.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maps constructed quickly in the wake of a disaster are also useful tools
 for identifying and assessing damage, especially when combined with images
 of the area before a disaster.
 For this to be most efficacious in assisting relief operations, “before”
 maps must be very recent, while “after” maps must be created as swiftly
 as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, in the aftermath of a disaster, mapping may take too long
 using satellites or traditional manned aircraft.
 Satellite imaging technology cannot currently penetrate cloud cover, often
 leading to delays in image capture after extreme weather events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Structural Integrity Assessment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tsunamis,
 and floods, as well as man-made disasters such as explosions and arson,
 can all cause immense damage to the structural integrity of buildings and
 infrastructure.
 Even small-scale events can cause serious damage.
 For example, the 2011 Virginia Earthquake, though measuring only 5.8 on
 the Richter scale, caused significant structural damage to such famous
 landmarks as the Washington Monument and the National Cathedral.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assessing structural damage after a disaster comes with many potential risks.
 Assessors may have to enter buildings in danger of collapse or access hard-to-r
each places like the undersides of bridges.
 Drones have proven their usefulness in assessing structural damage over
 a wide area, locally, and even in building interiors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, or Explosive (CBRNE) Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heavy industry and power generation relies on hazardous chemicals and fuels,
 including fi ssile material to create nuclear power.
 Malfunctions in factories or power plants, accidents while transporting
 hazardous materials, terrorism and criminal sabotage all have the potential
 to create unexpected chemical, biological or nuclear disasters.
 These devastating events require fast and eff ective disaster response
 and relief eff orts, but by their nature are extremely unsafe for relief
 workers.
 Characteristics of CBRNE events are: •Toxic / radioactive / explosive environme
nts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Toxic / radioactive / explosive environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Unprepared / disrupted surfaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rapidly changing environmental situations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lack of information and data on the extent of the disaster.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drones significantly reduce human exposure to unsafe environments while
 providing continuous monitoring and data validation in the most extreme
 conditions.
 Sending drones into a CBRNE area can help rescue workers quickly and safely
 locate sources of contamination/danger and the scope of the damage, providing
 invaluable situational awareness.
 Drones can also be used to repair damage, quickly deliver needed equipment
 to disaster teams, and apply chemical retardants or dispersants.
 Additionally, most drones can be deployed from unimproved locations, ensuring
 that even if airfields are not present or are unusable, aircraft can still
 be deployed to the area.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While drones have been used primarily in post-CBRNE disaster damage assessment
 and establishing situational awareness, the uses of drones in these environment
s are nearly endless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, drones could have been used to distribute goods to the family
 of Thomas Duncan, the man infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia, who
 returned to Dallas, Texas, in fall 2014.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drones have many uses in the preparedness and prevention stages of disaster,
 as well.
 For instance, drones fitted with methane sniff ers could detect a gas leak
 in a storage tank before it ignited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Search and Rescue Operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many dynamic tactical challenges accompany search and rescue operations
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "redCross"

\end_inset

.
 Searching for people or wreckage over vast areas like deserts, oceans,
 rugged mountainous and forested terrain can be very time consuming and
 difficult.
 This can lead to crew fatigue, decreasing their effectiveness in searching
 and increasing the likelihood of pilot error.
 Furthermore, once survivors are located, many rescue / evacuation operations
 must be carried out in hazardous environments (CBRNE, low visibility, rugged
 terrain, etc.).
 The use of unmanned systems in these situations allows operations to be
 conducted without exposing a flight crew to unnecessary danger.
 Search and rescue operations often embody the “3-D” model (Dull, Dirty,
 Dangerous) of missions best suited to drones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Insurance Claims Response and Risk Assessment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insurance companies play an invaluable role in assisting disaster relief
 efforts.
 When people lose their homes and possessions and when businesses stuff
 er property damage and business interruption, insurance companies are there
 to provide them with the material support they need to begin the rebuilding
 process.
 Insurance coverage can help disaster-stricken areas recover much more quickly
 and comprehensively than would have been possible otherwise.
 For these reasons, it is imperative that insurance companies act as eff
 actively and efficiently as possible in the wake of a disaster.
 Insurance companies could use drones to fly over an affected area, assessing
 damage to insured property, developing situational awareness for deploying
 additional claims adjusters on the ground, and supporting the claims response
 process.
 Using drones will also reduce the inherent dangers of inspecting damaged
 properties.
 Drones provide more options to review properties, which otherwise would
 be inaccessible due to safety concerns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Logistics Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The damage to infrastructure that occurs after major disasters is often
 one of the most signifi cant obstacles to effi cient disaster relief.
 Blocked roads, damaged rail, and destroyed sea and airports can severely
 curtail disaster recovery by delaying delivery of needed supplies and equipment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drones provide an alternative for logistical support after a disaster.
 Drones can fly above destroyed infrastructure, and many, particularly rotary-wi
ng craft, do not require runways for takeoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Drone logistics support will also help disaster responders directly.
 Any extra time that disaster responders can devote to actively mitigating
 a disaster or searching for and rescuing survivors will save lives and
 reduce costs.
 Many rescue workers currently devote substantial time to establishing logistica
l support for other responders, ferrying equipment and essential supplies
 like food and water.
 Drones can help speed up this process.

 two small rotary-wing drones to assess damage to cathedrals in Mirandola,
 Italy, after an earthquake in 2012.
 Such an assessment is impossible with manned systems.
 
\end_layout

Drone technology is cost-efficient
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
While a robust drone system can require significant upfront capital cost,
 drones are still often cheaper than manned aircraft to purchase and operate.
 Furthermore, by developing relationships with drone service companies,
 emergency response organizations can pay only for the tools that they need
 before and after disasters, lowering costs.

Autopilot Overview 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basis for autopilot system operation is error correction.
 When an aircraft fails to meet the conditions selected, an error is said
 to have occurred.
 The autopilot system automatically corrects that error and restores the
 aircraft to the flight attitude desired by the pilot.
 There are two basic ways modern autopilot systems do this.
 One is position based and the other is rate based.
 A position based autopilot manipulates the aircraft’s controls so that
 any deviation from the desired attitude of the aircraft is corrected.
 This is done by memorizing the desired aircraft attitude and moving the
 control surfaces so hat the aircraft returns to that attitude.
 Rate based autopilots use information about the rate of movement of the
 aircraft, and move control surfaces to counter the rate of change that
 causes the error.
 Most large aircraft use rate-based autopilot systems.
 Small aircraft may use either.

Guidance System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Guidance is defined as: The process for guiding the path of an object towards
 a given point, which in general may be moving.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Determines a path to follow based on commanded signals (waypoints – altitude
 - speed) by the operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many methods to make a guidance system depends on what the autopilot supposed
 to do (tracking a moving target which is time-dependent) or (follow a predefine
d path which is time-independent).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The guidance system of any aerial vehicle must handle three dimensions.
 It will be decoupled into two parts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Horizontal(East-West)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vertical(altitude)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Guidance laws are composed of speed and steering laws, which can be combined
 in different ways to achieve different motion control objectives.but we
 must know about the different motion control scenarios in order to find
 what suits our application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
motion control scenarios 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
motion control scenarios are typically divided into the following categories:
 point stabilization, trajectory tracking, and path following.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The control objective of a target-tracking scenario is to track the motion
 of a target that is either stationary (analogous to point stabilization)
 or that moves such that only its instantaneous motion is known, i.e., such
 that no information about the future target motion is available.
 Thus, in this case it is impossible to separate the spatio-temporal constraint
 associated with the target into two separate constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The control objective of a path-following scenario is to follow a predefined
 path, which only involves a spatial constraint.
 No restrictions are placed on the temporal propagation along the path.
 However, the control objective of a path-tracking scenario is to track
 a target that moves along a predefined path (analogous to trajectory tracking),
 which means that it is possible to separate the related spatio-temporal
 constraint into two separate constraints.
 Often, the spatial constraint is considered more important than the temporal
 constraint, such that if both cannot be satisfied simultaneously, the spatial
 constraint takes precedence (i.e., to move along the path, albeit at a distance
 behind the target).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The control objective of a path-maneuvering scenario is to employ knowledge
 about vehicle maneuverability to feasibly negotiate (or somehow optimize
 the negotiation of) a predefined path.
 As such, path maneuvering represents a subset of path following, but is
 less constrained than path tracking since spatial constraints always take
 precedence over temporal constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Line of Sight Guidance
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Line of sight (LOS) guidance is classified as a so-called three-point guidance
 scheme since it involves a (typically stationary) reference point in addition
 to the interceptor and the target.
 The LOS denotation stems from the fact that the interceptor is supposed
 to achieve an intercept by constraining its motion along the line of sight
 between the reference point and the target.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Pure Pursuit Guidance 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Pure pursuit (PP) guidance belongs to the so-called two point guidance schemes,
 where only the interceptor and the target are considered in the engagement
 geometry.
 Simply put, the interceptor is supposed to align its velocity along the
 line of sight between the interceptor and the target.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Constant Bearing Guidance 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Constant bearing (CB) guidance is also a two-point guidance scheme, with
 the same engagement geometry as PP guidance.
 However, in a CB engagement the interceptor is supposed to align the relative
 interceptor-target velocity along the line of sight between the interceptor
 and the target.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A ground station is typically a software application, running on a ground-based
 computer, that communicates with your UAV via wireless telemetry.
 It displays real-time data on the UAVs performance and position and can
 serve as a virtual cockpit, showing many of the same instruments that you
 would have if you were flying a real plane.
 A GCS can also be used to control a UAV in flight, uploading new mission
 commands and setting parameters.
 It is often also use to monitor the live video stream from a UAV's cameras.

Telemetry is what you use to send and receive data between your drone and
 your ground station.
 Adding telemetry to your drone is very useful, but is not always necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Telemetry modules are the actual radio devices that transmit and receive
 the data.
 You will have one onboard your drone, and one on the ground plugged onto
 your ground station device.
 The most important thing when using telemetry modules for your given autopilot,
 is that they will often need to be paired together so they can communicate.

We can see that the price of any professional cameras is so high.
 but you can overcome this by buying a consumer camera and convert to NIR
 camera through NIR filter in front of its lenses .Nevertheless this modified
 camera is in the same level as other professional cameras due to additional
 hardware and their specific user online help.
